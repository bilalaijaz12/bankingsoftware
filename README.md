# Banking Software
## About
Version: 1.0.0

Open Source

## Objectives
Create an open source software for processing banking transactions.
40% of all banking systems are written in COBOL. This open source application is to change the banking system.
Making the banking system faster, safer, easier and more secure is beneficial for the entire industry.
Providing an open source foundation for banking software using advanced applications and architecture. 

## Architecture
At the moment here's my idea for the software layout:
### UI:
* Application bones built with Python
* Main UI built using webpages (HTML + CSS)
* Submits and inputs done through JavaScript

### Backend:
* Server hosted by AWS
* No-SQL database structure
* Use NOde.js to retreive and send data from database
* Transaction database stored in blockchain

## Requirements:
* IDE or text editor
* Node.js
* ExpressJS library
* Python 3
* Local server (XAMPP, WAMP, etc.)
